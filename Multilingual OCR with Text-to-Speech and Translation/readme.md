Multilingual OCR with Text-to-Speech and Translation

This project is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) application integrated with Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Translation capabilities. 
It allows users to upload an image containing text, extract the text using OCR, detect the language, convert it to speech, and optionally translate it into another language.
